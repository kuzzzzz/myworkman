        <p>
          The My-Work-Man organization was made possible first by the special
          grace of God and two long-time friends who have been together for a
          over decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          We came up with this idea during the end of our youth service program
          when we realized we were almost done and there was no sustainable job
          opportunity in view.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to take matters into our hands and figure something out for
          ourselves which gave rise to the birth of the platform and today we
          are committed to seeing the narrative of every Nigerian youth change.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to wake up in a world where money is no longer an issue for
          the average Nigerian and where ideas and innovation are thriving, We
          are committed to helping individuals and already established
          businesses build successful enterprises and we want your help as well,
          to make this the reality of the Nigerian youth.
